Infer simple steps, anyone can get up and give their hula hoop a spin. 1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the hula hoop at waist height with both hand sand then give it a good spin. 2. Shift your weight between your front and back foot to keep the hula hoop spinning and maintain momentum. 3. Don’t worry if you struggle to maintain momentum and the hula hoop falls. The more you practice, the more your technique will improve."/>
