    "description": "This book is intended to be an introduction to some of the issues surrounding open research data in a range of academic disciplines. It primarily contains newly written opinion pieces, but also a handful of articles previously published elsewhere (with the authors’ permission in each instance). Importantly, the book is meant to start a conversation around open data, rather than provide a definitive account of how and why data should be shared. The book is open access, published under the Creative Com- mons Attribution License (CC BY), to facilitate further debate and allow the contents to be easily and widely spread. Readers are encouraged to reuse, build upon and remix each chapter; repository managers, data curators and other communities are encour- aged to detach and distribute the chapters most relevant to them to their peers and colleagues.",
