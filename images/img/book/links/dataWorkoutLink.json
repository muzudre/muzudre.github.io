Broccoli also contains the compound glucora-phanin, which can be processed into an anti-cancer compound sulfo-raphane, though the anti-cancer benefits of broccoli are greatly reduced if the vegetable is boiled. Broccoli is also an excellent source of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical which boosts DNA repair in cells and appears to block the growth of cancer cells. </p><p class='article-color'>Weight Reduction: Boiling broccoli reduces the levels of suspected anti-carcinogenic compounds, such as sulfo-raphane, with losses of 20 to 30% after five minutes, 40 to 50% after ten minutes, and 77% after thirty minutes.However, other preparation methods such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying had no significant effect on the compounds. </p><p class='article-color'>Broccoli has the highest levels of carotenoids in the brassica family.

  "paragraph": "<div class='mt-2'> <p class='article-color'>Sugars are a type of simple carbohydrate that occur naturally in some foods and drinks. They are also an additive in certain foods and drinks. Consuming too much sugar can lead to health problems, such as increasing the risk of weight gain, diabetes, tooth cavities, and more. Heart disease. High-sugar diets may increase the risk of heart disease. The results of a 15-year study suggest that people with a lot of added sugar in their diet are significantly more likely to die from heart disease than people with minimal amounts of added sugar in their diet. </p><p class='article-color'>Lack of nutritional value. Sugar is an empty calorie.Adding it to foods and drinks significantly increases their calorie content without adding any nutritional benefit. The body usually digests these foods and drinks quickly. This means that they are not a good source of energy. Products that naturally contain sugar are different. For example, fruits and dairy products contain natural sugars. The body digests these foods at a slower rate, making them a lasting source of energy. Consuming empty calories undermines the health benefits of consuming other foods and drinks that do have nutritional value. It can also cause imbalances, where nutrient deficits can lead to further health complications. </p><p class='article-color'>Weight gain. A significant risk of consuming excess dietary sugar is weight gain. In most cases, sugary foods and drinks are high in calories. Consuming too many of these products will lead to weight gain, even with regular exercise. Limiting the amount of sugar in a diet is one of the simplest ways to prevent weight gain. Tooth cavities. Sugar consumption can cause tooth decay, which may lead to the development of cavities. After eating sugar, bacteria in the mouth form a thin layer of plaque over the teeth. These bacteria react with the sugars present in foods and drinks. This reaction triggers the release of an acid that damages teeth. Limiting the intake of foods high in sugar is one effective way to prevent tooth cavities. </p><p class='article-color'>Diabetes. There is a link between consuming sugary drinks and developing type 2 diabetes. A high-calorie diet of any kind can lead to type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of data from 310,819 people found that those with a high consumption of sugary drinks had a 26 percent greater risk of type 2 diabetes than those with a low consumption. The study defined high consumption as between one and two sugary drinks per day. The American Diabetes Association recommend avoiding sugary drinks to prevent type 2 diabetes. </p></div>"
