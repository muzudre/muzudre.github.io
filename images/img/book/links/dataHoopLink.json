  "paragraph": "<div class='mt-2'> <p class='article-color'>With the summer in our midst, it's time to go outside and get fit with hoop dancing. Whether or not you have chosen to begin your hooping journey, it's great to learn and practice these basic moves. You'll be flowing with hoops in no time. </p><h3>1. Waist hooping</h3> <p class='article-color'>The most basic hoop move of them all, of course, is waist hooping. Although it is around the body, the move is all in the foot. If you need to get the hoop going and not fall down, plant one foot in front of the other, and then begin your first rotation by starting the hoop and pushing it as hard as you can. Then begin to rock back and forth from one foot to the other as you shift your weight. Eventually, you will begin to feel the hoop touching your body in the same places, and you will get into a groove. Remember: This takes practice. Have patience and don't give up. </p><h3>2. Hand hooping</h3> <p class='article-color'>Begin by putting your right hand out, as if you were going to give someone a handshake and keep your thumb up. Place the hoop in the corner of your thumb and hand; this is the sweet spot for hand hooping. You can then grab the hoop at the bottom, with the top of the hoop to the sky, then let the hoop fall and open your hand like you are giving a handshake. Once the hoop falls, you move your hand up and down briskly for the hoop to continue to circle around your hand. </p><h3>3. Halo</h3> <p class='article-color'>This is very similar to hooping on your hand, except it is above your head.The easiest way to begin this move is to hold the hoop flat in front of you, then begin to spin around and slowly lift your hand up while spinning. As soon as the the hoop is above your head, let the hoop spin in your hand in the same way you spin it in front of you. </p><h3>4. Spinning</h3> <p class='article-color'>One of the most basic and useful moves of the hoop world is the spin. Sounds easy, but see how long you can spin around in a circle without getting dizzy... you're probably dizzy as you're reading this.You want to get your spinning down, as it makes 80 percent of all hoop moves easier to do. Try to waist hoop and spin around and watch what happens. The trick is to focus your eyes on one point and continue to turn your body and make contact with the hoop. </p><h3>5. Neck hooping</h3> <p class='article-color'>OK, so it's not particularly a beautiful move, and most hoopers don't do it very often, but it is the first step to begin shoulder hooping. So get this movement down and you'll be on your way.This motion is very similar to waist hooping. Hold the hoop at your neck and throw the hoop around it. When you catch the sweet spot in your spin (usually at the second rotation), you will then rock the top half of your body back and forth, just like waist hooping. </p><h3>6. Flow</h3> <p class='article-color'>Turn on your favorite song or album and just dance. This is the simplest way to learn your style and come up with new moves. When you're in the moment, it's easy to transition your movements and let your body do what it naturally does. </p></div>",

  "subtitle": "Weighted hoops. Are they more effective than dance hoops?",
  "cover": "",
  "paragraph": "<div class='mt-2'> <p class='article-color'> Weighted hoops. Are they more effective than dance hoops? Do they burn more calories? Do you need a weighted hoop? To answer these questions I had to do a test. The results were interesting. </p><h3>First of all, let’s define what a Weighted Hoop really is.</h3> <p class='article-color'> A hoop that weighs more than 1kg/2lbs is usually considered a weighted hoop. Hoops that are made of extra heavy plastic, rubber and sometimes metal are referred to as weighted hoops. Some hoop makers may call their hoops weighted hoops even when they are not very heavy, so it is best to check the weight and size of your hoop before you buy it. </p><h3>Results and opinions:</h3> <p class='article-color'> After waist hooping with the weighted hoop for 10 mins I burned 40 calories. After waist hooping with the dance hoop for 10 minutes I burned 58 calories. <br/> <b>The Weighted Hoop made me feel uncomfortable and almost a little sick in the stomach.</b> The weight was far too heavy and I would not feel safe dancing, moving or doing any tricks with the heavy, weighted hoop. I felt certain that it would bruise me and I was scared to drop it on my feet. </p><p class='article-color'> The Dance Hoop felt more comfortable and because it was lighter, but not too light, I had to work a little harder and felt my muscles activated more and it gave me more of that euphoric feeling that I love from a workout. <br/> In my opinion, <b>extra heavy, Weighted Hoops are unnecessary and uncomfortable, they restrict my movement.</b> Movement is what burns more calories and makes me feel more toned, stronger and more creative. <b>I am worried that the extra heavy weight might cause bruising on my waist or be doing damage to my body.</b> </p><p class='article-color'>Beginner hoopers or hoopers who enjoy on body hooping  should be looking for a diameter that makes it easy for them to keep the hoop up and spinning but they do not need the extra, uncomfortable weight of a heavy, weighted hoop. </p><h3>Please read these instructions if you still want to get a weighted hula hoop.</h3> <div class='article-color'> <ul> <li>Weighted Hula Hoops are an exercise aid and must alwaysbe used with correct technique.</li><li>Always consult your doctor prior to commencing any newexercise programme.</li><li>Please do not use this item or these exercises as a substitutefor any exercise, treatment, dietary regime, or rehabilitationwhich has been prescribed by a doctor.</li><li>If you experience discomfort or unusual pain while usingCore Balance items, or while following Core Balance exerciseguides, stop the activity immediately.</li><li>The information contained within this document are notmedical guidelines but for educational purposes only.
