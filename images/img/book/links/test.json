  "p1": "Broccoli has more Vitamin C than an orange and contains high amounts of antioxidants that will help to repair your muscles and bulk up your immune system. It also contains photochemical which have anti-estrogen properties that help lower estrogen levels, increase testosterone and help fight off body fat storage.",
  "p2": "It also contains multiple nutrients with potent anti-cancer properties, such as di-indolylmethane and small amounts of selenium. A single serving provides more than 30 mg of vitamin C and a half-cup provides 52 mg of vitamin C. Broccoli also contains the compound glucora-phanin, which can be processed into an anti-cancer compound sulfo-raphane, though the anti-cancer benefits of broccoli are greatly reduced if the vegetable is boiled. Broccoli is also an excellent source of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical which boosts DNA repair in cells and appears to block the growth of cancer cells.",
  "p3": "Weight Reduction: Boiling broccoli reduces the levels of suspected anti-carcinogenic compounds, such as sulfo-raphane, with losses of 20 to 30% after five minutes, 40 to 50% after ten minutes, and 77% after thirty minutes.However, other preparation methods such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying had no significant effect on the compounds.",
  "p4": "Broccoli has the highest levels of carotenoids in the brassica family. It is particularly rich in lutein and also provides a modest amount of beta-carotene."

They are also rich in dietary fiber, B vitamins, essential minerals such as magnesium, copper, manganese, calcium, and potassium as well as monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, fats which potentially may lower LDL cholesterol. Typical of nuts and seeds, almonds also contain phytosterols such as Beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, sitostanol, and campestanol, which have been associated with cholesterol-lowering properties.",
  "p2": "Preliminary research associates consumption of almonds with elevated blood levels of high-density lipoproteins and lower low-density lipoproteins.",
  "p3": "Almonds may cause allergy or intolerance. Cross-reactivity is common with peach allergens (lipid transfer proteins) and tree nut allergens. Symptoms range from local signs and symptoms (e.g., oral allergy syndrome, contact urticaria) to systemic signs and symptoms including anaphylaxis (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms).",

  "p2": "Grapefruit seed extract (GSE) has been shown to have strong antimicrobial properties against fungi. It is also believed to have antimicrobial properties for bacteria, however, there are no known studies that demonstrate its efficacy. Additionally, although GSE is promoted as a highly effective plant-based preservative by some natural personal care manufacturers, studies have shown that the apparent antimicrobial activity associated with GSE preparations is merely due to contamination with synthetic preservatives.",
  "p3": "There is a popular myth that grapefruits contain high amounts of spermidine, a simple polyamine that may be related to aging. The myth probably relies on the confusion between spermidine and putrescine. While citrus fruits show high amounts of putrescine, they contain very little spermidine.",

Lactose-intolerant individuals may tolerate yogurt better than other dairy products due to the conversion of lactose to the sugars glucose and galactose, and due to the fermentation of lactose to lactic acid carried out by the bacteria present in the yogurt. Yogurt contains varying amounts of fat. It is non-fat (0% fat), low-fat (usually 2% fat) and plain or whole milk yogurt (4% fat).",
  "p2": "Yogurt is a portion of valuable health food for both infants and elderly persons. For children, it is a balanced source of protein, fats, carbohydrates, and minerals. For senior citizens, who frequently have more sensitive colons or who no longer produce much lactase, yogurt is also a valuable food. Elderly intestines showed declining levels of Bifidus bacteria, which allow the growth of toxin-producing and, perhaps, cancer-causing bacteria. Yogurt consumption may help prevent osteoporosis.",

Consuming too much sugar can lead to health problems, such as increasing the risk of <code>weight gain</code>, <code>diabetes</code>, <code>tooth cavities</code>, and more. <br> Heart disease. <br> High-sugar diets may increase the risk of heart disease. The results of a 15-year study suggest that people with a lot of added sugar in their diet are significantly more likely to die from heart disease than people with minimal amounts of added sugar in their diet.",
  "p2": "Lack of nutritional value. Sugar is an empty calorie.Adding it to foods and drinks significantly increases their calorie content without adding any nutritional benefit. The body usually digests these foods and drinks quickly. This means that they are not a good source of energy. Products that naturally contain sugar are different. For example, fruits and dairy products contain natural sugars. The body digests these foods at a slower rate, making them a lasting source of energy. Consuming empty calories undermines the health benefits of consuming other foods and drinks that do have nutritional value. It can also cause imbalances, where nutrient deficits can lead to further health complications.",
  "p3": "Weight gain. A significant risk of consuming excess dietary sugar is weight gain. In most cases, sugary foods and drinks are high in calories. Consuming too many of these products will lead to weight gain, even with regular exercise. Limiting the amount of sugar in a diet is one of the simplest ways to prevent weight gain. Tooth cavities. Sugar consumption can cause tooth decay, which may lead to the development of cavities. After eating sugar, bacteria in the mouth form a thin layer of plaque over the teeth. These bacteria react with the sugars present in foods and drinks. This reaction triggers the release of an acid that damages teeth. Limiting the intake of foods high in sugar is one effective way to prevent tooth cavities.",
  "p4": "Diabetes. There is a link between consuming sugary drinks and developing type 2 diabetes. A high-calorie diet of any kind can lead to type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of data from 310,819 people found that those with a high consumption of sugary drinks had a 26 percent greater risk of type 2 diabetes than those with a low consumption. The study defined high consumption as between one and two sugary drinks per day. The American Diabetes Association recommend avoiding sugary drinks to prevent type 2 diabetes."
