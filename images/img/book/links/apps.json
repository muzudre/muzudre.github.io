But what’s not to love about resistance bands? They’re lightweight, versatile, and easy to stow in a gym bag or carry-on, making them an ideal choice for the guy who wants to be able to train anytime, anywhere. You can use them on their own, or add them to more standard exercises to vary up your resistance for a more diverse workout.",
